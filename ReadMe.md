Hello there,

This is my directory, it is called the world-of-computer,because it is 
really another world. It has information about me. It is my first time 
knowing about Unix and learning different commands. The directory is 
divided into five folders, each folder has a little information about 
me.The folers are as follows:

1.Who am I?

2.what is something I know?

3.Where am I going?

4.What is important to me?

5.What is possible?


Navigating through these foldrs, you find a ReadMe.md file in each of 
these folders.I hope you guys like my simple directory. I am also doing my 
best to learn more about coding.
