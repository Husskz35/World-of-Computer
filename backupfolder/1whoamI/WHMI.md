Hi, my name is Hussein. I am very ambitious person. I like to learn new 
things in life and I put time and effort to accomplish what I am 
learning.Challenging myself is the only thing that I am competing 
with,because challenging oneself is what makes someone grow stronger and 
wiser. Challenging for me means facing the problem and solving it, not run 
away from it; and this is who I am.
