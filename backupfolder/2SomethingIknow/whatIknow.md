I studied English by myself and it was a challenge for me; but here I am, 
I solved the problem.I learned English grammar. It was a complete 
different world for me when it comes to how to construct a sentence, its 
syntax and semantic and its pragmatic or meaning. It is a language similar 
in some why to unix or may be coding. I also know a little bit about 
mechanics and cars. when I was a teenager I used to install satellite 
dishes, it was interesting for me.
